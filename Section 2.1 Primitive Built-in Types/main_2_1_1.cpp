int have minimum size of 16 bits with have size around -32767 to +32767
long have minimum size of 32 bits with have size around -2,147,483,647 to +2,147,483,647
long long minimum size of 64 bits with have size around -9.22 * 10^18 ~ +9.22 * 10^18
shorthave minimum size of 16 bits with have size around -32767 to +32767

unsigned and signed type are unsigned used for positive number only, while signed type can having both
negative and positive.

float	6 significant digits (usually 32 bits)
double	10 significant digits (usually 32 bits)
